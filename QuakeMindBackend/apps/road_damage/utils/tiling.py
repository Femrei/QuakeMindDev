    The Segformer inference runs over overlapping 512px patches, so its cost
    scales roughly with pixel count. A larger radiusKm would otherwise push
    more tiles into a fixed tile cap -- either silently cropping the analyzed
    area back down, or (if the cap is raised to honor the radius) inflating
    inference time a lot for a wide analysis. Scaling zoom down for a larger
    radius keeps the tile/pixel budget (and so inference time) roughly
    constant while still covering the real requested area.
